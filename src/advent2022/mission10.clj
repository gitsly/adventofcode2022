(comment "
The CPU has a single register, X, which starts with the value 1. It supports only two instructions:

addx V takes two cycles to complete. After two cycles, the X register is increased by the value V. (V can be negative.)
noop takes one cycle to complete. It has no other effect.
The CPU uses these instructions in a program (your puzzle input) to, somehow, tell the screen what to draw.

Consider the following small program:

noop
addx 3
addx -5
